      <span class=\\\"p6\\\" (click)=\\\"reydavid()\\\">Rey David</span> \\n        to apply new learned technologies. \\n        The website is an online retail site that specializes in Japanese animation (Anime) \\n        titles and American live-action titles. The entire product inventory in the website \\n        represents Rey's own private collection of entertainment media. \\n        Every item found in the website exists in Rey's own library, and is not for sale. \\n    </p>\\n    <h4 class=\\\"bold\\\">History of Animation</h4>\\n    <p>\\n        The Animegination website is a Node.js application written in Angular 6, \\n        Typescript and Bootstrap. The REST APIs run as an Azure App, \\n        the backend database resides in Azure SQL Server, \\n        and other services are hosted in Microsoft Azure. \\n        In years past, <span class=\\\"p6\\\" (click)=\\\"reydavid()\\\">Rey David</span> \\n        has built earlier versions of the Animegination website \\n        using the latest Microsoft technologies of the time. \\n        The first version was written in 2002 using Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 technology. \\n        In 2005, the website was upgraded with Silverlight technology. In 2008, \\n        the website was replaced with Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5 technology. In 2012, \\n        the website was rewritten with ASP.NET MVC 4 technology.  And in 2019, \\n        it was repaced yet again with Angular 6, Typescript and Azure technologies. \\n    </p>\\n    <h4 class=\\\"bold\\\">Future of Animegination</h4>\\n    <p>\\n        In December 2019, <span class=\\\"p6\\\" (click)=\\\"reydavid()\\\">Rey David</span> \\n        published a Hybrid Mobile App version of Animegination.  \\n        Using essentially the same code base as the website (write once deploy everywhere), \\n        he deployed the mobile app in both the Android and the iOS operating systems. \\n        The Animegination mobile app is now available to download for free in both \\n        the Google Play Store (for Android phones) and the Apple App Store (for iOS phones).  \\n        Just search for the app named ANIMEGINATION.\\n    </p>\\n    <p> \\n        In February 2013, Rey David  \\n        also published a Windows 8 Application version of Animegination.  \\n        The Windows 8 App may be downloaded for free from the Microsoft Store.  \\n        For as long as web media and mobile media technologies evolve, \\n        Animegination will continue to evolve with it. \\n        <span class=\\\"p6\\\" (click)=\\\"reydavid()\\\">Rey David</span> \\n        will make sure of that. \\n        We look forward to the future, and the exciting new technologies that it will bring.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4

From the time we receive your order and place it in our system, standard processing time is 24-48 hours. \\n        The delivery time after processing varies based upon the shipping method that you have selected. \\n        Typical delivery times for each shipping method are listed in the \\\"Current Rates\\\" section of this page.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        All pre-pack items are counted as a single item for shipping costs.\\n    </p>\\n    <p class=\\\"bold\\\">\\n        If you are a domestic customer (US) and order over $49, Economy shipping is free.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n

likely now), you will receive it in very short order. \\n        However, if it’s out of stock (either here or from the manufacturer), \\n        then you’ll have to wait for it regardless of the shipping method you choose. \\n        Express shipped items are shipped via UPS 2 Day Air and typically arrive at least one week \\n        sooner than standard shipping.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        Please be aware that if you have a PO Box, or are stationed in the service, \\n        our shipping is limited to Mail and Priority Mail (Economy and Standard Shipping options) \\n        because UPS will not deliver to these locations.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        Backordered items usually take an average of 10-14 business days. \\n        If it is an extremely popular item, or it is an

You will need to call UPS at 1-800-PICK-UPS to report the incident. \\n        Although it is not necessary, it is also a good idea to call us and let us know that a problem has occured \\n
